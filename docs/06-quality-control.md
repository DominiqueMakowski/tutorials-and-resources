# Quality control

When processing data, it is considered good practice (and is also very useful!) to inspect the intermediate output files/data created after every few steps. Here are some resources that can guide you through this process.

###Let's start with introduction:


"Quality Checks for fMRI Data - Lecture on quality control for neuroimaging data, especially fMRI data. 
##Quality checks include:

1. Looking for susceptibility and pathological artifacts;
2. Checking whether motion exceeds your lab's thresholds;
3. Keeping records to make sure you have the data that you should have." -
